# Fashion Week — Static Website Template

This is a simple, responsive static website template for a Fashion Week show. It includes:

- A hero landing section with event dates and CTAs
- Schedule cards for each day of the festival
- Featured designers section
- Image gallery with a lightweight lightbox
- Tickets/RSVP area with a demo contact form
- Mobile-friendly navigation

How to use
1. Clone or copy the files into your project directory.
2. Replace placeholder images in the `gallery` and `hero` with real image files:
   - `images/gallery1.jpg`, `images/gallery2.jpg`, etc.
   - Replace the `.hero-photo` placeholder with an actual background image or an <img>.
3. Customize text, dates, and emails in `index.html`.
4. Host as a static site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host).

Files
- index.html — main page
- css/styles.css — styles
- js/main.js — client-side interactions
- README.md — this file

Deployment
- GitHub Pages: push to a repository and enable Pages in repository settings (use "main" or "gh-pages" branch).
- Netlify / Vercel: drag-and-drop or connect the repo for CI/CD.

Notes
- The RSVP form is client-side only. To accept real RSVPs, connect the form to an API endpoint, serverless function, or a form provider (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- Replace placeholder mailto links with a ticketing provider or a purchase flow.

If you want, I can:
- Convert this into a React or Vue app
- Add server-side RSVP handling (Express, Firebase, or serverless)
- Integrate a payment/ticketing flow or Stripe checkout
- Create a CMS workflow (Netlify CMS / Contentful) for event updates
